# Create a new list from two list using the following condition
#Given two list of numbers, write a program to create a new list such that the new list should 
#contain odd numbers from the first list and even numbers from the second list.


# Pseudocode

# Initialize  the given list
# Initialize empty list and store results
# Using for loop iterate the list number 1
    # Check if the number is odd
    # If it's odd, append it to the result_list
# Using for loop iterate the list number 2
    # Check if the number is even
    # If it's even, append it to the result_list
# Print results
